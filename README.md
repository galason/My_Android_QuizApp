# My_Android_QuizApp


I developed this project as part of the Udacity 2018 Code Reviewer training.
 
The requirements were to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of my choice with at least four different questions, and a method that verifies the answers and displays the final results in a Toast. I chose to present ten questions about JAMB science quiz in a combination of free text answers and multiple choice answers.
